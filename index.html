<!-- There was an attempt to seperate words based on "value"
Different colors represent different things
Objects, actions, names, people, places, and just plain words-->

<!-- Write Up
I decided to use the hashmap ds because when thinking of frequency I immediately thought
about key and value. key being the word, value being its frequency. I found this easiest as
everytime I encountered a new word all I had to do was increment its value by one. If it
was a new word, I'd insert it and add a default value of 1. I ran into a problem however.
I realized my list was not in order, and in general hashmaps are not ordered. 



I'd definitely want to improve the overall visual of the project. I previously dabbled in HTML/CSS
before since I was an admin for a wiki which involved me doing a ton of entry data, but 
I was never under a time constraint which allowed more planning. Realistically this would
be a 3/10 for effort. 

Initially I started the assignment with a song (as instructed), but after I was finished I was
speaking with a friend about movies, which inevitably ends with me mentioning LOTR. I
realized "Hey, if this worked with lyrics it would work with chapters.. and I am always
in the mood to reread LOTR". I thought, this isn't exactly what was instructed, but after
taking a look at the general assingment, it was stated to "prepare a text file that contains 
text to anaylze. It could (key word could) be song lyrics to your favorite song". I thought, 
LOTR isn't a song, but it is a book, and my favorite book at that. In the end I decided, I
may as well make this assingment fun for myself.

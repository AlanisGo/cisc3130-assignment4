Assignment 4 - Write Up


For my visual, there was an attempt to separate words based on "value".
Different colors represent different values, such as:
Objects (Red), Actions (Pink), Names (Blue), People (Green), Places (Purple), and just plain Words (Orange).
Words that are in gray are those that have a value of 1 (appear only once).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I decided to use the hashmap ds because when thinking of frequency I immediately thought
about key and value. Key being the word, value being its frequency. I found this easiest as
everytime I encountered a new word all I had to do was increment its value by one. If it
was a new word, I'd insert it and add a default value of 1. Although the sorting aspect
required more thinking, hashmap in general made the most sense to me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I decided to use word bubbles as my visual because there is no mistaking what the bubble
represents in this case. Larger bubbles correlates to larger frequency. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'd definitely want to improve the overall visual of the project. One issue I encountered
with my bubble usage was the cutoff of words. Unfortunately, the smaller the bubble, the
less of the word is previewed. When viewed directly on the site created, hovering would
show the word. However, as an image alone you're unable to preview the word. This is 
something I would like to look into, possible creating a script that would increase the size
of the bubble when hovering in order to view the entire word. I would give my project a
4/5. The website is simple and to the point. But the inability to view all the words
isn't ideal. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Initially I started the assignment with a song (as advised), but after I was finished I was
speaking with a friend about movies, which inevitably ends with me mentioning LOTR. I
realized "Hey, if this worked with lyrics it would work with chapters.. and I am always
in the mood to reread LOTR". I thought, this isn't exactly what was instructed, but after
taking a look at the general assignment, it was stated to "prepare a text file that contains 
text to analyze. It could (key word "could") be song lyrics to your favorite song". I thought, 
LOTR isn't a song, but it is a book, and my favorite book at that. In the end I decided, I
may as well make this assignment fun for myself. Not only that but while cutting out 
stopwords from songs I realized that my list would get shorter and shorter, not making
the outcome very fun. With a chapter from a book, especially LOTR, there is a lot more
room to work with, and I realized that even with a large list of stopwords there were still
many words to look at.
